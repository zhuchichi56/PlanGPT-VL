- Added InferenceParams dataclass controls for inference max_workers and empty-response retries.
- Implemented true parallel requests via ThreadPoolExecutor in tools.inference_utils.parallel_image_inference.
- Added retry for empty responses to reduce CPT empty outputs.
- Suppressed Pydantic serialization warnings globally in tools.inference_utils.
- Extended tools.run_pipeline CLI to accept inference parameters and wire them into PipelineConfig.
- Added broader warning filters for Pydantic serializer warnings in tools.inference_utils and tools.run_pipeline.
- Treat whitespace-only responses as empty and retry accordingly.
- Removed batch/checkpoint inference helpers; pipeline now uses direct parallel_image_inference.
- Simplified pipeline and filtering to remove batch size parameters.
- Updated benchmark script and README to reflect non-batch API.
